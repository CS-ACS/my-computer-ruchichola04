## `Commentary`
1. A brief description of your relationship to your computer. Do you like it, or not? What is your history with this computer and/or what is the computer's history? One or two sentences will do.
- I have had this laptop for at least 2 years, I really like it-- over the time I have personalized it and made it my own. This used to be my sister's laptop but I got it when remote learning started (she got a new one). The only thing I don't like about it is that it's battery drains very quickly.
2. A brief description of how your computer's performance is affected by its hardware configuration (at least two of the aspects listed above) in a way that you can perceive as a user. For example, what kind of activities cause your computer to slow down and what do you think is the reason?
- One thing I have frequently noticed in my laptop is how fast it's battery drains-- after hitting 50% my laptop just *locks up* and shuts down it does not open unitl I connect it to the charger. I think this is because the battery of this laptop has become old and weak and it needs a new battery. Another thing I notice is that sometimes my laptop gets hot and starts making this noise-- making it seem like it's overwhelmed. I think this is because the fan could be obstructed or the air vents are covered. This overheating often causes programs to freeze and takes my laptop longer to perform basic tasks (open chrome/setting).
